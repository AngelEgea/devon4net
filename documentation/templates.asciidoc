== WebAPI Template
This section contains all of the information about the template that corresponds to the Devon4net WebAPI. This template will allow you to easily create a functional API with everything set up so you can start coding for your specific domain. 

Firstly, all the details about the contents of the package will be explained. Going through all of the directory tree explaining the most imporant concepts. Then we will show an example of how to add the entity Student from the domain layer all the way to the controller, so you can understand how the architecture works on this template and how the layers interact with each other.

=== Devon4Net.Application.WebAPI
This is the startup project of the template. Its main purpose is to launch the api and configure it using the settings files. The following figure shows the directory tree you will find when you first use the template.

.Devon4Net.Application.WebAPI Directory tree
image::images/Application.WebAPI_tree.png[]

Everything will be set up in the `Program.cs` file as for any .Net 6 Core API project. Going through this file, you will find all the configuration included with the template, such as middlewares and Dependency Injection.

For each environment you can have a different configuration if you wish. You will find an `appsettings.Development.json` file where the configuration for the different components used in the template is placed. Please go through the documentation of each component to learn more about how are they configured. 

=== Devon4Net.Application.Implementation
This is where all the magic happens. This project holds all the classes needed to implement the API end-points. The following image shows the structure you will find in this project.

.Devon4Net.Application.WebAPI.Implementation Directory tree
image::images/Application.WebAPI.Implementation_tree.png[]

NOTE: Please refer to documentation about Architecture to understand better the proposed architecture which is Onion Architecture.

==== Configuration

In this directory the Configuration is placed, you will find all the dependency injection code for this project in the static class `DevonConfiguration`. The code is divided into many private extensions based on their intended use, all of which are called by one main public extension for the `IServiceCollection` interface in the `Program.cs` file.

TIP:  If you need to segregate chunks of code, don't be afraid to add extra static classes. This will improve reading and it will make it much easier to locate items later.

==== Domain

As you may have learned thanks to the architecture document, this is the core of the application. It holds the entities and the contracts for the operations you can execute on them, that last being the repository interfaces. 

You will be able to find also the different database contexts for the application in the Database directory. These contexts will allow `EntityFramework` to work properly by extending `DbContext` class.

.Devon4Net.Application.WebAPI.Implementation Domain layer
image::images/Application.WebAPI.Implementation.Domain.png[]

The repositories interfaces extend from a generic repository interface `IRepository<T>` available in Devon4Net. As you can see in figure 3, Devon4Net already comes with some examples of implementation for some entities. Please revise them so that you have a better understanding of how they work.

==== Data 

The Data directory corresponds to the Data Layer and implements all the interfaces contracts. This Repositories extend from a generic repository implementation `Repository<T>` available in Devon4Net. As you can see in the next figure, the template also come with some examples of implementation.

.Devon4Net.Application.WebAPI.Implementation Data layer
image::images/Application.WebAPI.Implementation.Data.png[]

==== Business

The Business directory is where all the application logic is placed, it corresponds to the Business Layer. You will find a lot of implemented examples as shown in the next image.

.Devon4Net.Application.WebAPI.Implementation Business layer

These are:

. *AntiForgeryTokenManagement:* This is an example of how to use the XSRF protection in API controllers. It contains a controller class with a working example.

=== Sample of use

NOTE: If you don't know how to install and use this template, please refer to documentation on how to do it.

In this part we will be creating CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations for the entity type `Student`. Before that, we will delete the samples that come with the template. 

==== Step 1: Entity

First we will need the object `Student`. For that we will need to create a new `Student.cs` class in `Domain\Entities`:

[source, c#]
----
public class Student
{
    public long Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Surname { get; set; }
}
----

Our student should have an Identifier, and we will also put some interesting properties, name and surname for example.

TIP: Is good practice to override `object` methods: `Equals(object o)`, `GetHashCode()` and `ToString()`.

==== Step 2: Context

EntityFramework will need a context to be able to work with Students. Lets create a `StudentContext.cs` class in `Domain\Database`:

[source, c#]
----
public class StudentContext : DbContext
{
    public virtual DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }
    public StudentContext(DbContextOptions<StudentContext> options) : base(options)
    {
    }
}
----

==== Step 3: Repository contract

The repository contract in `Data\RepositoryInterfaces` will allow us to inject the repository and will increase decoupling. It will be implemented in the next step. You can inherit methods from Devon4Net `IRepository` as shown, but we will be also implementing a couple of queries:

[source, c#]
----
public interface IStudentRepository : IRepository<Student>
{
    Task<long> DeleteById(long id);
}
----

Everything should be asynchronous making use of the `Task` class.

==== Step 4: Repository implementation

Now we will need a repository implementation for the previous interface. It will be placed in `Data\Repositories`, it will inherit also from Devon4Net generic repository and will implement interface methods:

[source, c#]
----
public class StudentRepository : Repository<Student>, IStudentRepository
{
    public StudentRepository(StudentContext context) : base(context)
    {
    }

    public async Task<long> DeleteById(long id)
    {
        var deleted = await Delete(t => t.Id == id).ConfigureAwait(false);
        if (deleted) return id;
        throw  new ArgumentException($"The Todo entity {id} has not been deleted.");
    }
}
----

==== Step 5: StudentDto 

To increase decoupling, we will create a copy of the entity Student in `Business\Dto` for the Business layer. To make it a little different we will be including the surname in the property `FullName` and it will be separated before being stored in the database and viceversa:

[source, c#]
----
public class StudentDto
{
    public long Id { get; set; }
    public string FullName { get; set; }
}
----

We will need also a converter placed in `Business\Converters` so we can transform it in both directions:

[source, c#]
----
public static class StudentConverter
{
    public static StudentDto EntityToDto(Student item)
    {
        if (item == null) return new StudentDto();
        return new StudentDto
        {
            Id = item.Id,
            FullName = item.Name + " " + item.Surname 
        };
    }

    public static Student DtoToEntity(StudentDto item)
    {
        if (item == null) return new Student();
        return new Student
        {
            Id = item.Id,
            Name = item.FullName.Split(" ")[0],
            Surname = item.FullName.Split(" ")[1]
        };
    }
}
----

==== Step 6: Service

Now we will need a service in `Business\StudentManagement\Service`. The service will execute all the necessary operations.  In this case as it is a simple CRUD it will only call the repository. The Devon4Net Service class implements Unit of Work pattern.
[source, c#]
----
public interface IStudentService
{
    Task<IEnumerable<StudentDto>> GetAllStudents();
    Task<Student> CreateStudent(StudentDto student);
    Task<long> DeleteStudentById(long id);
}
----

[source, c#]
----
public class StudentService: Service<StudentContext>, IStudentService
{
    private readonly IStudentRepository _studentRepository;

    public StudentService(IUnitOfWork<StudentContext> uoW) : base(uoW)
    {
        _studentRepository = uoW.Repository<IStudentRepository>();
    }

    public async Task<IEnumerable<StudentDto>> GetAllStudents()
    {
        Devon4NetLogger.Debug("GetTodo method from service TodoService");
        var result = await _studentRepository.Get().ConfigureAwait(false);
        return result.Select(StudentConverter.EntityToDto);
    }

    public async Task<StudentDto> CreateStudent(StudentDto student)
    {
        var result = await _studentRepository.Create(StudentConverter.DtoToEntity(student));
        return StudentConverter.EntityToDto(result);
    }

    public async Task<long> DeleteStudentById(long id)
    {
        var todo = await _studentRepository.GetFirstOrDefault(t => t.Id == id).ConfigureAwait(false);
        if (todo == null) throw new ArgumentException($"The provided Id {id} does not exist");
        return await _studentRepository.DeleteById(id).ConfigureAwait(false);
    }
}
----

==== Step 7: Controller
The controller will end up looking like this and needs to be placed in `Business\StudentManagement\Controllers`. It uses the `IStudentService` via dependency injection.
[source, c#]
----
[EnableCors("CorsPolicy")]
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class StudentController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IStudentService _studentService;

    public StudentController(IStudentService studentService)
    {
        _studentService = studentService;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    [ProducesResponseType(typeof(List<StudentDto>), StatusCodes.Status200OK)]
    [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status400BadRequest)]
    [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status404NotFound)]
    [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status500InternalServerError)]
    public async Task<ActionResult> GetStudents()
    {
        return Ok(await _studentService.GetAllStudents().ConfigureAwait(false));
    }

    [HttpPost]
    [ProducesResponseType(typeof(StudentDto), StatusCodes.Status201Created)]
    [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status400BadRequest)]
    [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status404NotFound)]
    [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status500InternalServerError)]
    public async Task<ActionResult> Create(StudentDto student)
    {
        var result = await _studentService.CreateStudent(student).ConfigureAwait(false);
        return StatusCode(StatusCodes.Status201Created, result);
    }

    [HttpDelete]
    [ProducesResponseType(typeof(long), StatusCodes.Status200OK)]
    [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status400BadRequest)]
    [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status404NotFound)]
    [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status500InternalServerError)]
    public async Task<ActionResult> Delete(long id)
    {
        return Ok(await _studentService.DeleteStudentById(id).ConfigureAwait(false));
    }
}
----

==== Step 8: Dependency Injection

Now we are ready to inject the context in `Configuration\DevonConfiguration.cs`. In this example we are creating a database stored in memory:

[source, c#]
----
services.SetupDatabase<StudentContext>(configuration, "Default", DatabaseType.InMemory).ConfigureAwait(false);
----

Also the repository and the service, so we can use them in the entire solution.
[source, c#]
----
services.AddTransient<IStudentRepository, StudentRepository>();
services.AddTransient<IStudentService, StudentService>();
----

==== Test

Now you can run the application and go to the path `swagger/index.html`.

NOTE: take a look at your application port and the protocol you configured (http or https).

== gRPC Template
In this part of the document you will learn what is gRPC and how the devon4net gRPC template works. 

To help you understand how the template works, we will first go over some general concepts concerning gRPC technology in broad strokes. Then continue describing the contract shared between client and server and how it is formed using Google's Protocol Buffers. And last but not least, both the GrpcClient and the GrpcServer will be explained.

=== gRPC 
gRPC is a modern open source high performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework. It is totally independent of the language used on the client side and the server side. 

In gRPC a client app can directly call a method on a server application. Both parts need to share a file that acts as a contract. This way compatibility is ensured between client and server without taking languages into account.

.gRPC diagram
image::images/gRPC.png[]

On the server side, we need to develop a service that implements the contract shared between both parts and also listens to client calls and process them using this implementation.

On the client side, the client can use the methods provided by this contract thanks to the "stub" (gRPC client). 

This file is the Protocol Buffer (".proto" file)and needs to be both in the client and the server for them to understand each other.

=== Protocol Buffers

Protocol buffers provide a cross-platform mechanism for serializing structured data. It is like a JSON file, but smaller and faster.

This protocol buffers are written in an language called `proto3`. The following piece of code describes an example:

[source, proto]
----
syntax = "proto3";

option csharp_namespace = "Devon4Net.Application.GrpcClient.Protos";

package greet;

// The greeting service definition.
service Greeter {
  // Sends a greeting
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply);
}

// The request message containing the user's name.
message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

// The response message containing the greetings.
message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
----

The first line, specifies that you are using the `proto3` version. There are other versions such as `proto2`.

The option `csharp_namespace` specifies the namespace of the proto file in C#.

A message types are definitions of object structures. A message might have different fields, that have:

* Type: Type of the field value. It can be any scalar type (int32, double, string...) or composite type (enumerations, other messages...).

* Number: Each field has a unique number which is used to identify the field.

* Rule: Singular (can have zero or one) or repeated (can be zero or multiple times rpeated)

You can also see a service contract, which is called `Greeter` and has a method `SayHello` that accepts a `HelloRequest` and returns a `HelloReply`, both also defined on the file.

=== Devon4Net.Application.GrpcServer

This project will launch the server that will be called from the GrpcClient and will manage the rpc calls to the available methods.  

The proto file, which is shown in the previous section, defines the contract for the service, that will need to be implemented in this same project. 

As you can see in the following figure, the proto file is placed in the directory `Protos`.

.GrpcServer directory tree
image::images/grpc_server.png[]

The service `GreeterService`, will need to extend `Greeter.GreeterBase` which is generated automatically thanks to the service named `Greeter` in the proto file. 

This service will need to override the method `SayHello` defined in the proto file. This method can be overriden from the class `Greeter.GreeterBase` as it was already implemented:

[source, c#]
----
[GrpcDevonService]
public class GreeterService : Greeter.GreeterBase
{
    public GreeterService()
    {
    }

    public override Task<HelloReply> SayHello(HelloRequest request, ServerCallContext context)
    {
        return Task.FromResult(new HelloReply
        {
            Message = "Hello " + request.Name
        });
    }
}
----

Notice the attribute `GrpcDevonService`. All services marked with this attribute will be auto registered in the `Program.cs` when adding the following line:

[source, c#]
----
builder.Services.AddGrpc();
.
.
.
app.SetupGrpcServices(new List<string> { "Devon4Net.Application.GrpcServer" });
----

The list of strings provided as argument is the list of assemblies where devon will look for gRPC services tagged with that attribute.

NOTE: Check the component documentation to learn more.

=== Devon4Net.Application.GrpcClient

The client project will access the GrpcServer project end-point thanks to the protocol buffer and the configuration in the `appsettings.{environment}.json`. For trying out the communication between the client and the server, you will find an end-point in the `GrpcGreeterController` class.

.GrpcClient directory tree
image::images/grpc_client.png[]

The configuration is done adding the following options to the settings file:

[source, json]
----
 "Grpc": {
    "EnableGrpc": true,
    "UseDevCertificate": true,
    "GrpcServer": "https://localhost:5002",
    "MaxReceiveMessageSize": 16, 
    "RetryPatternOptions": {
      "MaxAttempts": 5,
      "InitialBackoffSeconds": 1,
      "MaxBackoffSeconds": 5,
      "BackoffMultiplier": 1.5,
      "RetryableStatus": "Unavailable" 
    }
  },
----

NOTE: `GrpcServer` is the direction of the gRPC end-points. To learn more about the component configuration please visit the package documentation.

The following line will configure the component to use this configuration in the `Program.cs`:

[source, c#]
----
builder.Services.SetupGrpc(builder.Configuration);
----

The greeter controller will use a `GrpcChannel` injected in the constructor as follows:

[source, c#]
----
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class GrpcGreeterClientController : ControllerBase
{
    private GrpcChannel GrpcChannel { get; }

    public GrpcGreeterClientController(GrpcChannel grpcChannel)
    {
        GrpcChannel = grpcChannel;
    }
----

You will find that the end-point that accesses the gRPC service looks like this:

[source, c#]
----
[HttpGet]
public async Task<HelloReply> Get(string name)
{
    try
    {
        var client = new Greeter.GreeterClient(GrpcChannel);
        return await client.SayHelloAsync(new HelloRequest { Name = name }).ResponseAsync.ConfigureAwait(false);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Devon4NetLogger.Error(ex);
        throw;
    }
}
----

The `Greeter.GreeterClient` is created automatically and can be used when adding the reference to the proto file namespace with the `using` directive.
